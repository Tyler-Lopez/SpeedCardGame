## Note

This is a very new repository, however, as a note the progress of this is currently strongly in exploring card designs via. compose.

This is a very early example of the way shapes will be created in this project. As an effort to learn the canvas scope and corresponding mathematics, all shapes will be constructed via the Canvas composable.
